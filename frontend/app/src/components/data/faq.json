        "question": "How is it different from using Tezos?",
        "answer": "cTez can be used directly in smart contracts across Tezos DeFi without having to worry about the thorny “Who’s baking?” question when it is staked."

        "question": " That’s great! How can I get started using it?",

      {
        "id": 7,
        "question": "Why would someone create more than one oven?",
        "answer": "In the case that you want to whitelist an oven, or create one so multiple people can add Tezos to it."

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "How is the value of cTez determined?",
      "answer": "Algorithmically! More information about the formula and the ‘drift’ can be found in the documentation."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": " I’ve read something about ‘liquidation’ being possible, what does that mean?",
      "answer": "In the event that you are over or under collateralized by 6.7%, your oven can be closed and anyone can grab the collateral by sending it the outstanding cTez (or fraction thereof)."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "If that happens, is there a fee that must be paid?",
      "answer": "Yes! It is a 1/31 penalty for liquidation."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Can I use cTez in any Dapp that uses Tezos?",
      "answer": "Yes, but the developers behind the Dapp must update their smart contracts to work with it. Ex: Any token pair/XTZ, can be replaced by any token pair/cTez."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Is there a locking period for cTez?",
      "answer": "None, you can mint and redeem whenever you want!"
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What are the fees for minting and redeeming cTez?",
      "answer": "None, except for on-chain transaction fees, or gas."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "What is the ‘drift’?",
      "answer": "It is a system-wide parameter that varies over time, the floating peg against Tezos."
